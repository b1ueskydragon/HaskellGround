{-
Run-length encoding of a list.
Use the result of problem P09 to implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression method.
Consecutive duplicates of elements are encoded as lists (N E)
where N is the number of duplicates of the element E.

encode "aaaabccaadeeee"
[(4,'a'),(1,'b'),(2,'c'),(2,'a'),(1,'d'),(4,'e')]
